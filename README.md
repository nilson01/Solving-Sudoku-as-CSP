# Solving-Sudoku-as-CSP

 In this project I use a technique called constraint
propagation together with backtracking search to make an agent
that only considers reasonable solution candidates and efficiently
solves any Sudoku puzzle. This approach appears in many classical
AI problems, and the solution techniques have been extended
and applied to diverse problems in bioinformatics, logistics, and
operations research.s
